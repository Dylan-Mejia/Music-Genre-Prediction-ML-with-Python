# Music-Genre-Prediction-ML-with-Python
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a csv file containing user information about music genres. Inside the notebook, machine learning is demonstrated to make predictions based on a user's age and gender, predicting what kind of music they would like. A larger data set could be used for better predictions.
